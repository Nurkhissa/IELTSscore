# IELTS Band Scores: How they are calculated 

The IELTS band sores tables below explain the scoring to help you calculate and understand yous score. Understanding the requirments for your target score is essential for success in IELTS.

# How the IELTS Band Scores and Calculated

All IELTS scores are between 0 and 9. You can also get .5 scores as well (for example, 6.5 or 7.5). You will get a band score for each skill (listening, reading, writing and speaking) and also an overall band score. The overall band score is the average score of all the skills. See the table below as an example.


| Listening | Reading | Writing | Speaking | Overall |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| 8         | 7.5     |    7    |  7.5     |7.5      |


As explained on the IELTS website, overall test results are calculated to the nearest 0.5 or nearest whole band score. This means if the final score is not a precise 7.5 (as shown in the table above), your score is pushed to the nearest whole score or half score depending which is nearest. Below you can see examples of how this works according to IELTS:

* If your overall score is 6.1, your score will go down to 6. This is the nearest whole band score. In other words, 6.1 is closer to band 6 than to 6.5.
* If your overall score is calculated to be 6.85, your final result will be band 7. This is because 6.85 is closer to band 7 than to band 6.5.
* If your overall score is an average of 6.25, your score will be increased to 6.5. The score 6.25 is actually precisely between band 6 and 6.5, so in this case IELTS will push it up to the nearest score which is 6.5.
* If your overall score is an average of 6.75, your score will be increased to 7. This score again is precisely between 6.5 and band 7. In this case, your score will be rounded up to band 7.
